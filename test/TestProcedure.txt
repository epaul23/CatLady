1. Preparation
- Create a main class to run the testing
- Import all models and controllers
-Initialize game components and controllers which includes:
	-Hand of players
	-Board
	-Score
	-All controller classes
- Add different types of cards to player 1's hand and player2's hand

2. Testing

		-Test invalid inputs (enter an invalid action or invalid character when choosing a row/column)
		-Check if the system provide re-prompts for valid inputs or any error messages

		-Try drawing cards multiple times during turn
		-Validate that the 2nd call to draw cards does not work

		-Validate that the game re-prompts user or that an error message is generated
		-Try using a spray bottle when there is none in the player's hand
		-Validate that the game re-prompts user or that an error message is generated
		-Try using laser pointer card when another action has already been used
		-Validate that the game re-promts user or that an error message is generated
		-Try using lost cat, spray bottle, and draw cards after laser pointer card has been used
		-Validate that the game re-prompts user or that an error message is generated
		-Verify that ending a turn switches to the other player's hand for their turn

	2.3 CatFeedingController
